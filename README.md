# Coursera Capstone Project (IBM)
This repo is part of Data Science Capstone Project. A 9 course series created by IBM and hosted on Coursera Learning platform, it covers the entire process in Data Science from collecting data to making predictive conclusions based on the data.<br>
The "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods" is the project that completes this Specializatio Course. The problem and analysis approach are left for the learner to decide and explore on his own, with a requirement to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a problem that we can use the Foursquare location data to solve.
